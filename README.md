# Discription
The HP 210 G1 is known for running Windows 7, 8, or even 10. Developers often prefer to use Linux, and Kali Linux is popular among security professionals. However, today I've developed an EFI that allows you to run macOS Big Sur on the HP 210 G1.
# Note
This EFI file is for dual boot [macOS & Windows]. <br>
This project is a work in progress and is NOT THE FINAL RELEASE YET.
