# Description
The HP 210 G1 is known for running Windows 7, 8, or even 10. Developers often prefer to use Linux, and Kali Linux is popular among security professionals. However, today I've developed an EFI that allows you to run macOS Big Sur on the HP 210 G1.
# Note
This EFI file enables dual booting macOS and Windows if you want to boot macOS only just delete Microsoft folder from the EFI file. Please note that this project is a work in progress and is not the final release yet.
